# Improved Genetic Algorithm

We improve Genetic Algorithm (GA) for multi-UAVs path planning, aiming at energy consumption minimization.

Our improvements include:
- improve crossover opertation
- improve mutation opertation
- add evolution steps

This work include two steps: cluster and path planning

- For cluster, we use K-means where K denotes the number of avaliable UAVs.
- For path planning, our improved GA is adopted.
